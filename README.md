# API Sentiment Project!

## Welcome to my new project!

## This project focuses in a few things:

- This is a project where you can get some tweets and use a Sentiment Analyzer
to get the negativity or positivity of a given tweet. The tweets are only themed on one category: They are opinions about airlines and the
things that they want to complain or talk about, so you won't find tweets about
anything else here!

####Â Also you can tweet your own things and have some fun analyzing you emotions later!


- First, we started an API using flask! This will get our clients in touch with
our database so they can make some queries.

- Secondly, we filled our database in MongoDB with some tweets so you can make
some calls to the database and get some info.

- Next, we made the API able to post some tweets of your own, so now you can post some things too!

- Last but not least, the fun of this project is to use the Sentiment Analyzer
to get some emotional feedback from the tweets. Don't hesitate to apply that
on your own tweets and on the tweets from other people in the database!


Everything is connected to our MongoDB database so you can just get the info from
what's in there! Remember that this is not an enourmous database, so you can just fill it and make it bigger if you want to by posting lots of tweets!

Hope you enjoy the repo. Cheers!
